->About the Project

The Event Countdown Timer with Notification is a Windows Forms application developed in C# and .NET Framework 4.8.
It allows users to set upcoming events, track real-time countdowns, and receive timely notifications as the event approaches.

->Objectives

To design a system that efficiently manages event data and provides accurate countdowns.

To develop a user-friendly application for personal and organizational event tracking.

To implement a real-time notification system that alerts users before the event starts.

->Features

🧭 Real-time countdown that updates every second.

🔔 Notification alerts when the event is about to start or has started.

🧩 Simple GUI using Windows Forms for easy interaction.

❌ Error handling for invalid input (date/time).

📅 Event reminder system for better time management.

->Technologies Used

Programming Language: C#

Framework: .NET Framework 4.8

IDE: Visual Studio 2022

Libraries: System.Windows.Forms, System.Timers.

->Design and Implementation

The application is built using Windows Forms where the user enters an event name, date, and time.
Once started, a timer runs in the background to continuously calculate and display the remaining time.
When the countdown reaches zero, a notification message is displayed using a pop-up window.

📋 Implementation Highlights

Timer control triggers every second to update the countdown label.

Validation checks ensure proper input format for date and time.

MessageBox notifications alert users when the event starts or is about to start.

->Testing and Validation

Unit Testing: Verified that countdown and notifications work accurately.

Integration Testing: Ensured the timer, UI, and notification modules function together smoothly.

User Testing: Confirmed that the interface is simple and intuitive for end users.

->📈 Results

The application accurately tracks and displays time remaining until events.

Notifications alert users exactly one minute before and at the start of an event.

The tool provides an effective and easy way to manage personal or professional schedules.
